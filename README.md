# Introduction 📝
The **GradePass** node is designed to grade render passes directly without needing to extract them. It uses the subtractive method, and you can view and tweak the selected AOV in one single node.

It contains the same knobs as the Grade node, along with Hue Rotation, Saturation and some extra features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _This node does not address **NaN**/**Infinite** values or perform complex calculations to fix AOV issues._

# How to Use 📖

<h2>Viewer - Final Result</h2>

- It allows you to check the final result while you adjust the selected AOV;

<h2>Viewer - Solo AOV</h2>

- It allows you to isolate and check what passes you want to work on (similar to the **Shuffle** node);
