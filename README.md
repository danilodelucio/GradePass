# Introduction
The GradePass node is designed to grade render passes directly. It uses the subtractive method for AOVs without the need to extract them.

It contains the same knobs as the Grade node, along with Hue Rotation, Saturation and some extra features.

# Viewer

- **Solo AOV**: similar to the **Shuffle** node, it allows you to isolate and check what passes you want to work on;

You can use it along with the **Disable Adjustments** option to disable all the changes while you check the selected AOV.
