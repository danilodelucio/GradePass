# Introduction
The GradePass node is designed to grade render passes directly without the need to extract them. It uses the subtractive method, and you can view and tweak the selected AOV in one single node.

It contains the same knobs as the Grade node, along with Hue Rotation, Saturation and some extra features.

<h2>Viewer - Solo AOV</h2>

It allows you to isolate and check what passes you want to work on (similar to the **Shuffle** node);

You can use it along with the **Disable Adjustments** option to disable all the changes while you check the selected AOV.
