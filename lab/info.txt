In some cases, to get the final Diffuse, Reflection and so on, you need to combine them separately, then create a new channel and bring them back to the pipe.

For Octane Render, Redshift, V-ray and Arnold, you can pick the desired AOV directly in the Main tab. At the moment, the only setup you can get the final Diffuse, Reflection


------

This node is designed to straightforwardly grade render passes using the subtractive method for AOV compositing.

It prioritizes performance and shareability, allowing users to copy and send it to others without needing to install anything.

Please note that it does not address NaN/Infinite values or perform complex calculations to fix AOV issues.

For more advanced control, such as combining AOVs, you will need to create them separately and then bring the combined AOV (for example, with a Copy node) so that you can select it from the dropdown menu.


I hope you enjoy the tool!
